      "63 It measures just 9 inches in circumference , weighs only about 5 ounces , and it made of cork wound with woolen yarn , covered with two layers of cowhide , and stitched by hand precisely 216 times . It travels 60 feet 6 inches from the pitcher 's mound to home - and it can cover that distance at nearly 100 miles an hour . Along the way it can be made to twist , spin , curve , wobble , rise , or fall away . The bat is made of turned ash , less than 42 inches long , not more than 2 3/4 inches in diameter . The batter has only a few thousandths of a second to decide to hit the ball . And yet the men who fail seven times out of ten are considered the game 's greatest heroes . It is played everywhere . In parks and playground and prison yards . In back alleys and farmers fields . By small children and by old men . By raw amateurs and millionare professionals . It is a leisurely game that demands blinding speed . The only game where the defense has the ball . It follows the seasons , beginning each year with the fond expectancy of springtime and ending with the hard facts of autumn . Americans have played baseball for more than 200 years , while they conquered a continent , warred with *** one *** another and with enemies abroad , struggled over labor and civil rights and the meaning of freedom . At the games 's heart lie mythic contradictions : a pastoral game , born in crowded cities ; an exhilarating democratic sport that tolerates cheating and has excluded as many as it has included ; a profoundly conservative game that sometimes manages to be years ahead of its time . It is an American odyssey that links sons and daughters to father and grandfathers . And it reflects a host of age - old American tensions : between workers and owners , scandal and reform , the individual and the collective . It is a haunted game , where each player is measured by the ghosts of those who have gone before . Most of all , it is about time and timelessness , speed and grace , failure and loss , imperishable hope , and coming home .\tPEOPLE, \tmen\n",
